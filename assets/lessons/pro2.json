  "paragraph": "Asynchronous programming in Dart allows tasks to run without blocking the main thread. A Future represents a value that will be available later. The async keyword lets you mark a function as asynchronous, and await pauses execution until a Future completes. This makes asynchronous code easier to read compared to callbacks. Streams are used when receiving multiple asynchronous values over time.",
